Mass production and profit became more important. Quantity mattered more than the quality. The books and printed works in general lost a part of its humanity. The typefaces were not produced by craftsmen anymore. It was the machines printing and tying the books together now. The craftsmen had to let go of their craft and became a cog in the process.

All the books were handwritten and decorated with hand drawn ornaments and figures. A process of copying a book was long but each book, even a copy, was a work of art.","position":{"start":{"line":8,"column":1,"offset":1071},"end":{"line":8,"column":448,"offset":1518},"indent":[]}}],"position":{"start":{"line":8,"column":1,"offset":1071},"end":{"line":8,"column":448,"offset":1518},"indent":[]}},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"type":"text","value":"Human beings aren’t perfect. Perfection is something that will always elude us. There will always be a small part of humanity in everything we do. No matter how small that part, we should make sure that it transcends the limits of the medium. We have to think about the message first. What typeface should we use and why? Does the typeface match the message and what we want to communicate with it? What will be the leading and why? Will there be more typefaces in our design? On what ground will they be combined? What makes our design unique and why? This is the part of humanity that is left in typography. It might be the last part.
